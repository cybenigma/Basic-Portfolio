			Hello friend. Let me tell you a bit about myself. So, obviously, my name is Michael Curtis as seen above and on each page in this site, finally my name up in lights!!! So back to knowing about me, I have some favorite things and activities that I like to do which will give you a small insight into who Michael is. Here are some of my favorite things: movie: Dune, music genre: Reggae (makes me feel happy), and food type: soul food and home cooking. Those are just a few and they can and have changed from time-to-time, but that is a good measure of what I like. As for activities, I enjoy motorcycle riding, golf, sports, and I am a fulltime News Junkie. More passionately, I like anything tech. I read tech stuff for pleasure like some people read novels for pleasure. I try to branch out more, but I just enjoy learning things technical. Which brings me to my real passion, web development.
			</p>

			Web development has been a growing passion that started when I was a kid in high school. I was fascinated by sites, or rather more like bulletin boards of the eighties. I think I can track my launch into the world of tech to a bulletin board that I connect to at my high school. From then, I immersed myself into technology and never looked back. While I have done a bunch of different jobs, I have always tried to infuse technology into whatever I was doing at the time. As I got further into my work experience I moved more towards holding jobs in Technology and have for at least the last 20 years.

			Probably the most important take away from knowing Michael is balance. I believe in balance in my life. I have noticed folks lately seem to be too involved in the events of today to too little involved in the world of things that affect their lives. While I firmly have a position on most important topics, I try very hard to stay open to alternative points of view. Sadly, that point of view seems to be missing from our fellow Americans these days, but I have hope that that will change some day.
